Game "Magic Ball"

Magic 8 ball - a ball that looks like a billiard ball number 8, 
but larger - usually with a diameter of 10-11 cm, 
inside which there is a container with dark liquid, such as ink. 
In a liquid, a figure with 20 surfaces floats - an icosahedron, 
on each of which one answer is applied.

The answers are in the format “yes”, “no”, “absolutely accurate”, 
“bad chances”, “the question is not clear”, etc. There are 20 possible answers.

Design features: The figure with the answers is not a monolithic design, 
but consists of two parts interconnected. At the joints there are rigid joints (gaps). 
They have a certain meaning in the design and are deliberately created so that when the ball is shaken, 
air bubbles do not form in it, which in turn can float and interfere with the reading of the answer.

The game is written in the Ruby programming language.

To start the game, in the terminal, go to the folder with the game file, and run the command:

```ruby 8ball.rb```
